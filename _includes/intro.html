    <p>Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">{{ site.author.name }}</span>,
    a Post-Doc at
    <a href="https://www.surrey.ac.uk/cvssp">University of Surrey</a>, where I work
    on the EPSRC project <a href="http://cvssp.org/projects/maruss/new_web/">
    Musical Audio Repurposing using Source Separation</a>.</p>

    <p>I studied physics at the Carl von Ossietzky Universit채t Oldenburg, where I
    received my Diploma Degree with a thesis in the field of psychoacoustics and
    neuroscience in 2008. I received a Doctoral Degree from Technische
    Universit채t Berlin on the topic of perceptual assessment of sound field
    synthesis systems in 2014 and continued as a Post-Doc.
    In 2016 I moved as a Post-Doc to Technische Universit채t Ilmenau and was a
    Visiting Professor at Filmuniversit채t Babelsberg KONRAD WOLF.</p>

    <p>I'm interested in all things related to <strong>spatial audio</strong>
    ranging from <strong>sound field synthesis</strong>,
    <strong>stereophony</strong> and <strong>binaural synthesis</strong> to the
    <strong>modeling of the auditory perception</strong>.</p>

    <p>Here are a few projects I'm involved in or responsible for -- further
    details can be found in my <a href="{{ '/publications' | prepend:
      site.baseurl }}">publications</a> and <a href="http://github.com/hagenw">
      software projects</a>.</p>
