    <p>Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">{{ site.author.name }}</span>,
    a <span itemprop="jobTitle">{{ site.author.job }}</span> at
    <a href="https://www.tu-ilmenau.de/en/audio-visual-technology/">TU Ilmenau</a>
    and a visiting researcher at <a href="https://www.aipa.tu-berlin.de">TU Berlin</a>.
    </p>

    <p>I studied physics at the Carl von Ossietzky University Oldenburg, where I
    received my diploma degree with a thesis in the field of psychoacoustics and
    neuroscience in 2008. I received a Doctoral Degree from Technische
    Universit√§t Berlin on the topic of perceptual assessment of sound field
    synthesis systems in 2014.</p>

    <p>I'm interested in all things related to <strong>spatial audio</strong>,
    ranging from <strong>sound field synthesis</strong>,
    <strong>stereophony</strong> and <strong>binaural synthesis</strong> to the
    <strong>modeling of the auditory perception</strong>.</p>

    <p>Here are a few projects I'm involved in or responsible for -- further
    details can be found in my <a href="publications/">publications</a>
    and <a href="http://github.com/hagenw">software projects</a>.</p>
