    <p>Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">{{ site.author.name }}</span>,
    a Researcher at
    <a href="https://audeering.com">audEERING</a>, where I work
    on signal processing and source separation for audio and speech.</p>

    <p>I studied physics at the Carl von Ossietzky Universit채t Oldenburg, where I
    received my Diploma Degree with a thesis in the field of psychoacoustics and
    neuroscience in 2008. I received a Doctoral Degree from Technische
    Universit채t Berlin on the topic of perceptual assessment of sound field
    synthesis systems in 2014 and continued as a Post-Doc.
    In 2016 I moved as a Post-Doc to Technische Universit채t Ilmenau and was a
    Visiting Professor at Filmuniversit채t Babelsberg KONRAD WOLF.
    In 2017 I was a Post-Doc at the University of Surrey.</p>

    <p>I'm interested in all things related to <strong>spatial audio</strong>
    ranging from <strong>sound field synthesis</strong>,
    <strong>binaural synthesis</strong>, and <strong>source separation</strong>
    to the <strong>modeling of the auditory perception</strong>.</p>

    <p>Here are a few university projects I'm involved in or responsible for --
    further details can be found in my <a href="{{ '/publications' | prepend:

      software projects</a>.</p>
