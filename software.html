          To use different audio data sets in machine learning pipelines
          it is desirable to store them in the same format.

    <h2>Scientific Publications Revisited</h2>

        <p>
          Scientific findings depend to a large
          degree on software and data.
          Consequently, scientific publications should evolve over time
          as they get tested,
          improved,
          or even falsified.
          To implement solutions that reach beyond the classical journal paper,
          I tried to present them as HTML pages,
          generated from a corresponding git repository
          and data publications.
          I selected
          <a href="http://sphinx-doc.org">sphinx-doc</a>
          instead of Jupyter notebooks
          for implementation
          as it allows for a more modular approach
          and re-usability.

        <p>
          The study of sound field synthesis techniques
          involves numerical simulations,
          which are crucial to evaluate them.
          In an effort started at the Technical Universit√§t Berlin
          we started developing
          and publishing
          the needed software.
          First implemented in Matlab/Octave
          and later in Python.

          The Two!Ears EU project
          investigated computational modelling
          of how humans assign meaning to auditory scenes.
          I worked on how humans judge the sound quality
          of spatial audio scenes,
          reproducibility of results,
          and the management and versioning
          of software and databases.

        <p>
          The AABBA project is an informal group
          of researches working
          in the field of binaural auditory modelling.
          In that group I was involved
          in developing the SOFA format
          for exchange and storage of head related impulse responses.
          I also contributed to the Auditory Modelling Toolbox
          which was a first try
          to collect models from different researchers
          to make them re-usable for others
          and foster reproducibility in auditory modelling.

          Before switching to Python I used
          <a href="https://gnuplot.org">Gnuplot</a>
          for producing plots for papers
          and web pages.
          I published a collection of howtos
          and converted common color pallettes
          to Gnuplot.
