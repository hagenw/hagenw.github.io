### Abstract

We report on the curation of several publicly available datasets for age and
gender prediction. Furthermore, we present experiments to predict age and gender
with models based on a pre-trained wav2vec 2.0. Depending on the dataset, we
achieve an MAE between 7.1 years and 10.8 years for age, and at least 91.1% ACC
for gender (female, male, child). Compared to a modelling approach built on
handcrafted features, our proposed system shows an improvement of 9% UAR for age
and 4% UAR for gender. To make our findings reproducible, we release the best
performing model to the community as well as the sample lists of the data
splits.

### Supplementary material

ONNX versions of the 24-layer and 6-layer model are available at
[https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7761387](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7761387),
together with the defined test splits from the paper.
