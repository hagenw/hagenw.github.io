### Abstract

Stereophony and Wave Field Synthesis (WFS) are capable of providing the listener
with a rich spatial audio experience. They both come with different advantages
and challenges. Due to different requirements during the music production stage,
a meaningful direct comparison of both methods has rarely been carried out in
previous research. As stereophony relies on a channel- and WFS on a model-based
approach, the same mix cannot be used for both systems. In this study mixes of
different popular-music recordings have been generated, each for two-channel
stereophony, surround stereophony, and WFS. The focus is on comparability
between the reproduction systems in terms of the resulting sound quality. In a
paired-comparison test listeners rated their preferred listening experience.

### Supplementary Material

The music mixes are provided for download at
[10.14279/depositonce-5173](http://dx.doi.org/10.14279/depositonce-5173). Note,
that they are stored in a channel based way, which means that for the WFS mix,
you will need a similar WFS system that can distribute the mixed 56-channels on
a circle.

If you are interested in the object based mixing for WFS, you might have a look
at the `ssr_wfs_scenes.zip` file which comes with
[10.14279/depositonce-5173](http://dx.doi.org/10.14279/depositonce-5173) which
was used with the [SoundScape Renderer](http://spatialaudio.net/ssr/) to create
the mix. The signal feeds you need for the single objects in the mix are
available at[10.5281/zenodo.55718](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.55718).

The mixes where adjusted to achieve the same loudness level at the center of the
listening area. This was done by performing measurements with a dummy head for
different levels of the mixes. The dummy head recordings are available at
[10.5281/zenodo.55719](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.55719).
