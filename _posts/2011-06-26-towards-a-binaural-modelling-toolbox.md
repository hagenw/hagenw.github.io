### Abstract

The Auditory Modelling Toolbox (AMToolbox) is a new Matlab/Octave toolbox for
developing and applying auditory perceptual models and in particular binaural
models. The philosophy behind the project is that the models should be
implemented in a consistent manner, well documented and user-friendly in order
to allow students and researchers to actively work with current models and
further develop existing ones. In addition to providing the models, it is a goal
of the project to collect published human data and definitions of model
experiments. This will simplify the verification of models by running the model
experiments and comparing the predictions to human data. The software is
released under the GNU Public License (GPL) version 3, and can be downloaded
from http://amtoolbox.sourceforge.net.
