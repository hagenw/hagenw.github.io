### Abstract

We present advancements with a software tool called Nkululeko, that lets users
perform (semi-) supervised machine learning experiments in the speaker
characteristics domain. It is based on audformat, a format for speech database
metadata description. Due to an interface based on configurable templates, it
supports best practise and very fast setup of experiments without the need to be
proficient in the underlying language: Python. The paper explains the handling
of Nkululeko and presents two typical experiments: comparing the expert acoustic
features with artificial neural net embeddings for emotion classification and
speaker age regression.
