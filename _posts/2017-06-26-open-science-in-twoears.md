### Abstract

Two!Ears was an EU funded project for binaural auditory modeling with ten
international partners involved. One of the project goals was to follow an Open
Science approach in all stages. This turned out to be a challenging task as the
project involved huge amounts of software, acoustical measurements, and data
from listening tests. On the other hand, it was obvious from the positive
experience with the Auditory Modelling Toolbox that an Open Science approach
would have a positive impact and foster progression afterwards. As there existed
no ready solution to achieve this goal at the beginning of the project,
different paths for data management were tested. It was especially challenging
to provide a solution for data storage. Here, the goal was not only the long
term accessibility of the data, but also the revision control of public and
private data for the development inside the project. In the end, the project was
able to make most of its software and data publicly available, but struggled to
apply the reproducible research principle to most of its papers. This
contribution will discuss best practices to actively support reproducible
research in large-scale projects in the acoustic community, points out problems
and solutions.
