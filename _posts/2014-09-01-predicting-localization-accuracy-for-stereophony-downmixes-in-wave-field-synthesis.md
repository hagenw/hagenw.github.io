### Abstract

Wave Field Synthesis enables the creation of a correct spatial impression
in an extended audience area. However, the synthesized sound scenes are most
often created with a model-based rendering approach. This enables, beside other
advantages, interactivity of the listener with the sound scene. On the downside
it requires anechoic recordings of every direct sound event of the sound scene,
a requirement that most often does not hold for music recordings and
productions.
In this study we investigate downmixing methods of reproducing two-channel
stereophonic recordings with Wave Field Synthesis. Thereby different virtual
loudspeaker layouts, like point sources and plane waves are arranged. It is
further investigated how they interact with different geometries of the
underlying loudspeaker array for Wave Field Synthesis. A linear, circular and
box shaped geometry is employed.
A common feature of stereophonic reproduction is the sweet-spot for
localization. Outside of the sweet-spot the listener start to localize the
reproduced sources towards the single loudspeakers. Recent advantages in
predicting the localization for Wave Field Synthesis setups with a binaural
model will be utilized in this study. Applying the binaural model the influences
of the downmixing method and the underlying geometry are investigated.
Especially the number of active loudspeakers and the usage of plane waves for
stereophonic presentation differ from a typical stereophonic setup and allow
to increase the possible sweet-spot size.
