### Abstract

Virtual environments which are based on binaural sound reproduction require
datasets of head-related transfer functions (HRTFs). Ideally, these HRTFs are
available for every possible position of a virtual sound source. However, in
order to reduce measurement efforts, such datasets are typically only available
for various source directions but only for one or very few distances. This paper
presents a method for extrapolation of measured HRTF datasets from the source
distance used in the measurements to other source distances.  The method applies
the concept of local Wave Field Synthesis to compute extrapolated HRTFs for
almost arbitrary source positions with high accuracy. The method is
computationally efficient and numerically stable.
