### Abstract

An open source toolbox for Sound Field Synthesis (SFS) is introduced. The
toolbox is able to numerically simulate sound fields synthesized by SFS methods
like Wave Field Synthesis or higher order Ambisonics.  Various loudspeaker
driving signals for the mentioned methods are provided for 2-, 2.5- and
3-dimensional synthesis. The toolbox allows mono-frequent as well as broadband
excitation signals. The latter allows to generate snapshots of the
spatio-temporal impulse response of a chosen reproduction technique. The toolbox
furthermore includes the computation of binaural room impulse responses (BRIR)
for a given SFS setup.  These can be used to simulate different sound field
synthesis methods via binaural resynthesis. The toolbox is provided for
Matlab/Octave and comes with an online documentation.


### Supplementary material

The Sound Field Synthesis Toolbox is under constant development. Beside its
Matlab/Octave version, also a Python version and a discussion of the underlying
theory is now available under [http://sfstoolbox.org](http://sfstoolbox.org).

If you use the Sound Field Synthesis Toolbox in your research, please cite not
only this publication, but also the exact version of the toolbox you used. Doi
entries for the versions are available on the [release
page](https://github.com/sfstoolbox/sfs/releases).
