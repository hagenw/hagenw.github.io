### Abstract

This paper reviews the current state of loudspeaker-based spatial sound
reproduction methods from technical perspective as well as perceptual
perspective. A nomenclature is developed that allows for a strict separation
between these two perspectives. The physical fundamentals, practical
realization, and results from perceptual studies are discussed for a number of
well-established and emerging reproduction techniques. Further, the paper
outlines novel approaches to spatial sound evaluation in terms of perceived
quality and provides a comparison of current approaches.
