### Abstract

This chapter outlines the problem of evaluating multichannel reproduction by
example of the wave-field synthesis method. This method is known for providing
good localization of reproduced source within an extended listening area. The
localization performance for a virtual point sources was investigated for
various listener positions and loudspeaker-array configurations. Respective
results of listening-test were compared with localization predictions by a
binaural model. With this model, a localization map can be obtained that covers
most listener positions within the synthesis area. With such a localization map,
designers of loudspeaker-setups for wave-field synthesis can estimate the
localization and localization accuracy to be expected from a given multichannel
setup. To enable perception of sound sources at arbitrary positions within the
synthesis area of a given wave-field synthesis implementation, input signals to
the two ears had to be generated. This was realized by means of dynamic binaural
synthesis, a technique that allows for instantaneous switching between different
listening scenarios. In a formal pre-test, it was verified that dynamic binaural
simulation has no influence on the listenersâ€™ localization performance as
compared to natural hearing. Both the test procedure and the modeling results
can be taken as a basis for further research regarding the evaluation of
multichannel reproduction, an area that is still sparsely covered.
