### Abstract

Wave Field Synthesis (WFS) is a well-established sound field synthesis technique
that uses a dense distribution of loudspeakers (aka secondary sources) arranged
around an extended listening area. The physical foundations of WFS assume a
smooth secondary source distribution. Practical systems are often of rectangular
shape, which constitutes a non-smooth secondary source distribution. The
resulting effects on the synthesized sound field are investigated in this paper.
The fundamentals of sound field synthesis are briefly reviewed and extended for
non-smooth secondary source distributions. It is shown that edges can result in
considerable amplitude and spectral deviations. The extended foundations serve
as a basis for potential countermeasures. A modification of the loudspeaker
driving signal is proposed to compensate for the edge effects. It effectiveness
is evaluated for practical systems.
