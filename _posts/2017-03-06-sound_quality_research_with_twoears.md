### Abstract

The paper presents an overview of the work conducted in the EC-funded
FET-Open project TWO!EARS. Starting from general considerations of
audio quality assessment, the overall TWO!EARS system architecture
as available at the end of the project is presented (www.twoears.eu). The
open-source testbed framework enables the scenario-based testing of
different bottom-up and top-down auditory modelling modules in the context
of differently complex auditory perception and scene analysis tasks.
Here, sound quality assessment represents one of the proof-of-concept
applications. The paper provides a summary of the different sound quality
assessment campaigns conducted in the project. These started with
a sound-quality paradigm based on localization and coloration for different
audio reproduction and sound-field synthesis techniques such as
stereo and Wave Field Synthesis. For the assessment of sound quality
in terms of preference for different system configurations, the problem
of appropriate reference signals was addressed by creating dedicated
mixes. For these, different parametric settings of individual mixing steps
were used. The resulting mixes were assessed in different tests using
a paired-comparison preference paradigm with presentation over different
spatial audio reproduction systems. The test results and available
modelling approaches are discussed, as well as future research to be
carried out using the TWO!EARS modelling framework.
