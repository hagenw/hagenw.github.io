### Abstract

Endfire loudspeaker arrays together with appropriate beamforming techniques
allow synthesizing sound fields which are confined to a narrow beam in direction
of the array. The practical performance of endfire beamforming techniques is
limited by the differences between the individual loudspeakers. Furthermore, the
direction of the sound beam can be steered only to a very limited extend. Sound
Field Synthesis techniques, like Wave Field Synthesis or the Spectral Division
Method, allow synthesizing focused sources in front of broadside loudspeaker
arrays. This contribution investigates the usage of focused sources as virtual
loudspeakers in endfire configuration. The basic properties of focused sources
are reviewed and assessed. Endfire beamforming techniques are employed in order
to optimize the directivity characteristics of the virtual array. The overall
performance of the approach is investigated in various aspects.
