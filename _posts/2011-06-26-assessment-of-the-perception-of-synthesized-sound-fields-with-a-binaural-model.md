### Abstract

Wave Field Synthesis (WFS) is a technique to synthesize a desired sound field in
an extended area surrounded by a secondary source distribution. In practice
these secondary sources are realized with loudspeakers and therefore a spatial
sampling of the secondary sources occurs. The sampling will lead to aliasing
artifacts in the sound field depending on the distance between the loudspeakers.
In the time domain these artifacts will occur as echoes. If a linear loudspeaker
array is used its finite length will further introduce artifacts in the sound
field. In this case the truncated array acts as a slit for the desired sound
field and diffraction takes place, which leads to additional waves occurring
from the edges of the loudspeaker array. The perception of these deviations from
the desired sound field depends on the strength of the deviation and on the type
of the desired sound field, e.g. if we have plane waves or a focused source
located within the listener area. A test was conducted to rate the different
perceptional dimensions of the artifacts. A binaural model after Lindemann
(1986a) was used to predict the perception and to get insight into the
mechanisms that may play a role in the perception of artifacts of synthesized
sound fields.
