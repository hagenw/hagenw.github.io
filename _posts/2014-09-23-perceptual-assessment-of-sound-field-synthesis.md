### Abstract

This thesis investigates the two sound field synthesis methods Wave Field
Synthesis and near-field compensated higher order Ambisonics.  It summarizes
their theory and provides a software toolkit for corresponding numerical
simulations. Possible deviations of the synthesized sound field for real
loudspeaker arrays and their perceptual relevance are discussed. This is done
firstly based on theoretical considerations, and then addressed in several
psychoacoustic experiments. These experiments investigate the spatial and
timbral fidelity and spectro-temporal-artifacts in a systematic way for a large
number of different loudspeaker setups. The experiments are conducted with the
help of dynamic binaural synthesis in order to simulate loudspeaker setups with
an inter-loudspeaker spacing of under 1 cm.  The results show that spatial
fidelity can already be achieved with setups having an inter-loudspeaker spacing
of 20 cm, whereas timbral fidelity is only possible for setups employing a
spacing below 1 cm. Spectro-temporal artifacts are relevant only for the
synthesis of focused sources. At the end of the thesis, a binaural auditory
model is presented that is able to predict the spatial fidelity for any given
loudspeaker setup.
