### Abstract

Wave Field Synthesis systems are known to suffer from coloration. Depending on
the applied number of loudspeakers comb-filter effects are present in the
amplitude spectrum. In a listening experiment participants rated the perceived
coloration of a synthesized point source compared to the reference case of a
single loudspeaker. The point source was presented by two-channel stereophony
and Wave Field Synthesis applying a circular loudspeaker array ranging from 14
up to 3 584 loudspeakers. Test participants were placed at different positions
in the audience area for Wave Field Synthesis. The whole experiment was done
using binaural synthesis.
