### Abstract

There is some uncertainty as to whether objective metrics for predicting the
perceived quality of audio source separation are sufficiently accurate. This
issue was investigated by employing a revised experimental methodology to
collect subjective ratings of sound quality and interference of singing-voice
recordings that have been extracted from musical mixtures using state-of-the-art
audio source separation. A correlation analysis between the experimental data
and the measures of two objective evaluation toolkits, BSS Eval and PEASS, was
performed to assess their performance. The artifacts-related perceptual score of
the PEASS toolkit had the strongest correlation with the perception of artifacts
and distortions caused by singing-voice separation. Both the
source-to-interference ratio of BSS Eval and the interference-related perceptual
score of PEASS showed comparable correlations with the human ratings of
interference.
