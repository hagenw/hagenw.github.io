### Abstract

Object based audio offers several new possibilities during the sound mixing
process. While stereophonic mixing techniques are highly developed, not all of
them generate promising results in an object-based audio environment. An
outstanding feature is the new approach of positioning sound objects in the
musical sound scene, providing the opportunity of stable localization throughout
the whole listening area. Previous studies have shown that even if object-based
audio reproduction systems can enhance the playback situation, the critical and
guiding attributes of the mix are still uncertain. This study investigates the
impact of different spatial distributions of sound objects on listener
preference, with a special emphasis on the distinction of high attention
foreground parts of the presented music track.

### Supplementary Material

The music mixes employed in this study are available from
http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.61000. Note, that the final mix provides the
driving signals for a circular loudspeaker array with 56 channels. If you would
like to reproduce it on another system you can generate the driving signals
yourself by using the [SoundScape Renderer](http://spatialaudio.net/ssr/), in
which you have to load the [scene files](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.61110)
and feed in the [signals of the single
objects](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.55718) for the song "lighthouse".
