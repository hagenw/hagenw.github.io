### Abstract

Object based audio offers several new possibilities during the sound mixing
process. While stereophonic mixing techniques are highly developed, not all of
them generate promising results in an object-based audio environment. An
outstanding feature is the new approach of positioning sound objects in the
musical sound scene, providing the opportunity of stable localization throughout
the whole listening area. Previous studies have shown that even if object-based
audio reproduction systems can enhance the playback situation, the critical and
guiding attributes of the mix are still uncertain. This study investigates the
impact of different spatial distributions of sound objects on listener
preference, with a special emphasis on the distinction of high attention
foreground parts of the presented music track.
