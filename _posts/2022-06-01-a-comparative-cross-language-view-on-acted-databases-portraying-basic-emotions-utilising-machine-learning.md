### Abstract

Since several decades emotional databases have been recorded by various
laboratories. Many of them contain acted portrays of Darwin's famous "big four"
basic emotions. In this paper, we investigate in how far a selection of them are
comparable by two approaches: on the one hand modeling similarity as performance
in cross database machine learning experiments and on the other by analyzing a
manually picked set of four acoustic features that represent different phonetic
areas. It is interesting to see in how far specific databases (we added a
synthetic one) perform well as a training set for others while some do not.
Generally speaking, we found indications for both similarity as well as
specificiality across languages.
