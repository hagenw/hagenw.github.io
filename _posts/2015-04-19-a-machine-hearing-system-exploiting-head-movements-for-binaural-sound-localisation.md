### Abstract

This paper is concerned with machine localisation of multiple active speech
sources in reverberant environments using two (binaural) microphones. Such
conditions typically present a problem for `classical' binaural models. Inspired
by the human ability to utilise head movements, the current study investigated
the influence of different head movement strategies on binaural sound
localisation. A machine-hearing system that exploits a multi-step head rotation
strategy for sound localisation was found to produce the best performance in
simulated reverberant acoustic space. This paper also reports the public release
of a free binaural room impulse responses (BRIRs) database that allows the
simulation of head rotation used in this study.
