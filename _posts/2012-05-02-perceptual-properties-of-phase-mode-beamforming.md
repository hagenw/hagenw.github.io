### Abstract

Several approaches to data-based binaural synthesis have been published
that process the sound field captured by a spherical microphone
array. The captured sound field is typically decomposed into
plane waves which are then auralized using head-related transfer
functions. The decomposition into plane waves is often based upon
modal beamforming techniques which represent the sound field with
respect to surface spherical harmonics. The achievable spatial bandwidth
is limited due to practical considerations. This paper investigates
the perceptual implications of these limitations in the context
of data-based binaural synthesis.
