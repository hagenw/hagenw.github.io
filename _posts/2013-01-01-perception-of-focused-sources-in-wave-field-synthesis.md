### Abstract

Wave Field Synthesis (WFS) allows virtual sound sources to be synthesized that
are located between the loudspeaker array and the listener. Such sources are
known as focused sources.  Due to practical limitations related to real
loudspeaker arrays, such as spatial sampling and truncation, there are different
artifacts in the synthesized sound field of focused sources. In this paper we
present a listening test to identify the perceptual dimensions that are
associated with these artifacts. Two main dimensions were found, one describing
the amount of perceptual artifacts and the other one describing the localization
of the focused source.  The influence of the array length on these two
dimensions is evaluated further in a second listening test. A binaural model is
used to model the perceived location of focused sources found in the second test
and to analyze dominant localization cues.
