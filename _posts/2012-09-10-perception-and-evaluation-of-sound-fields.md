### Abstract

Sound field synthesis techniques claim to recreate a desired sound field within
an extended listening area. In order to investigate the perceptual properties of
the synthesized sound field the listener has to be placed at different
positions. In practice that can be quite difficult with real loudspeakers.
Another possibility to perform listening tests is to present the field via
binaural synthesis. This study investigates whether binaural synthesis is
perceptually transparent for the purpose of localization studies for sound field
synthesis. A localization test is performed comparing real loudspeakers to two
different binaural synthesis configurations using non-individual head-related
transfer functions (HRTFs), once with and once without reflections. The results
show only slight differences between real speakers and HRTFs-based synthesis,
resulting in a one degree greater localization blur for the HRTFs without
reflections than for the other two cases.
