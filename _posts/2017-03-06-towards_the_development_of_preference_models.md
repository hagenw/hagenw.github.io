### Abstract

Typical research on the quality of speech and audio technology concerns
the impact of system characteristics on the signals, and is often focussing
on the transmission and reproduction side. However, less work is
reported on the influence of the content creation phase on the quality
that the listener is experiencing in the end. This contribution aims to
obtain more insights into this rather new area within the Quality of Experience
domain. For that purpose, the authors present a feasibility study
on the modeling of user preference ratings for different music production
techniques. In previous work, different mixes (in terms of compression,
equalization, reverb and positioning) of the same popular music piece
were generated and user preference ratings in form of paired comparisons
were collected. The present contribution continues this work by
investigating a number of modelling approaches that predict the preference
ratings for the different music mixes. While a general feasibility for
such models can be shown, a main limitation of this work is the currently
very limited amount of available material for robust modeling.
