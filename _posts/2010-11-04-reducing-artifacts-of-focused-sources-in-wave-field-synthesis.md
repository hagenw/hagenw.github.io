### Abstract

Wave Field Synthesis provides the possibility to synthesize virtual sound
sources located between the loudspeaker array and the listener. Such sources are
known as focused sources. Previous studies have shown that the reproduction of
focused sources is subject to audible artifacts. The strength of those artifacts
heavily depends on the length of the loudspeaker array. This paper proposes a
method to reduce artifacts in the reproduction of focused sources by using only
a subset of the loudspeakers of the array. A listening test verifies the method
and compares it to previous results.
