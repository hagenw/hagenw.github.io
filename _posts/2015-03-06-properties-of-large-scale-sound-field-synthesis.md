### Abstract

Sound field synthesis has been pursued as a promising approach for spatial audio
reproduction for large listening areas. Research is typically performed on small
and mid-size systems.  An increasing number of systems of cinema size and larger
exist, which have shown to exhibit properties that cannot be observed with
smaller setups. In particular, practical limitations lead to artifacts whose
perceptual saliency increases with array size. Depending on the situation, these
artifacts are most prominent in time domain or in frequency domain. In this
paper, we review the current state of knowledge on the properties of sound field
synthesis using large-size loudspeaker arrays regarding both direct sound and
reverberation.
