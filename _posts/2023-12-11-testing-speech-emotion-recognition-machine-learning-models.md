### Abstract

Machine learning models for speech emotion recognition (SER) can be trained for
different tasks and are usually evaluated on the basis of a few available
datasets per task. Tasks could include arousal, valence, dominance, emotional
categories, or tone of voice. Those models are mainly evaluated in terms of
correlation or recall, and always show some errors in their predictions. The
errors manifest themselves in model behaviour, which can be very different along
different dimensions even if the same recall or correlation is achieved by the
model. This paper investigates behavior of speech emotion recognition models
with a testing framework which requires models to fulfill conditions in terms of
correctness, fairness, and robustness.
