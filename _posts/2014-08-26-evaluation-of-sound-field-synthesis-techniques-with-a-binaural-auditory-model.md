### Abstract

Wave field synthesis and Ambisonics strive to reconstruct a sound field within a
listening area using the interference of loudspeaker signals. Due to the spatial
sampling, an error-free reconstruction is not achieved within the entire
listening area and consequently, the perceived quality of the reproduction may
be impaired. Specifically, sound events may be localized incorrectly and the
individual loudspeaker signals may result in perceived coloration. Here, a
binaural auditory model was employed to predict the localization error in
several off-center-listening positions and to visualize coloration artifacts.
The model outputs provided good match for perceptual data from previously
conducted listening tests, verifying the applicability of the model to evaluate
the reconstructed sound fields.
