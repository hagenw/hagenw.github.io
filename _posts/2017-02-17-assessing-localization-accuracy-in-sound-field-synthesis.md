### Abstract

Sound field synthesis methods like Wave Field Synthesis (WFS) and Near-Field
Compensated Higher Order Ambisonics synthesize a sound field in an extended area
surrounded by loudspeakers. Because of the limited number of applicable
loudspeakers the synthesized sound field includes artifacts. This paper
investigates the influence of these artifacts on the accuracy with which a
listener can localize a synthesized source. This was performed with listening
tests using dynamic binaural synthesis to simulate different sound field
synthesis methods and incorporated several listening positions. The results show
that WFS is able to provide good localization accuracy in the whole listening
area even for a low number of loudspeakers. For Near-Field Compensated Higher
Order Ambisonics the achievable localization accuracy of the listener depends
highly on the Ambisonics order and shows large localization deviations for low
orders, where splitting of the perceived sound source was sometimes reported.
