### Abstract

Wave Field Synthesis (WFS) is a loudspeaker-based auralization technique that
aims at the physical synthesis of a sound field within a large listening area.
In order to synthesize the complex sound field of a reverberant enclosure,
data-based rendering techniques are typically used. Here the spatio-temporal
structure of the sound field is captured by a microphone array. The microphone
signals are then post-processed in order to derive the loudspeaker driving
signals. In theory, the captured field can be synthesized almost perfect for a
wide frequency range. In practice, the limited number of microphones and
loudspeakers, equipment noise and sensor position mismatch will impair the
synthesized sound field. Consequently these technical restrictions may lead to
audible degradations. This contribution investigates the perceptual properties
of data-based WFS. The study considers the synthesis of a broad-band plane wave
captured by a microphone array under free-field conditions. Timbral as well as
spatial attributes, like localization and coloration, are investigated.
Cross-references to known results from model-based rendering are furthermore
highlighted.
