### Abstract

We present a time domain analysis and comparison of spatial discretization
artifacts in near-field compensated higher order Ambisonics and wave field
synthesis. Simulations of both methods on the same circular loudspeaker array
are investigated and the results are interpreted in terms of fundamental
psycho-acoustical properties of the human auditory system, most notably the
precedence effect. It can be shown that both methods exhibit fundamental
different properties regarding the synthesized first arriving wave fronts as
well as additional correlated wave fronts (echoes). The properties of both types
of wave fronts are a consequence of the combination of the spatial bandwidth of
the loudspeaker driving function and the fact that a finite number of spatially
discrete loudspeakers are employed.
