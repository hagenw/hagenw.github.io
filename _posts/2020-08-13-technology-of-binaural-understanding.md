### Abstract

The chapter outlines the concepts of Sound Quality
and Quality of Experience (QoE). Building on these, it describes
a conceptual model of sound quality perception and experience during
active listening in a spatial-audio context. The presented model of
sound quality perception considers both bottom-up (signal-driven)
as well as top-down (hypothesis-driven) perceptual functional processes.
Different studies by the authors and from the literature are discussed
in light of their suitability to help develop implementations of the
conceptual model. As a key prerequisite, the underlying perceptual
ground-truth data required for model training and validation
are discussed, as well as means for deriving these from respective listening
tests. Both feature-based and more holistic modeling approaches are analyzed.
Overall, open research questions are summarized, deriving trajectories
for future work on spatial-audio Sound Quality and
Quality of Experience modeling.
