### Abstract

Sound Field Synthesis (SFS) aims at production of wave fronts within a large
target region enveloped by a massive number of loudspeakers. Nowadays, these
techniques are known as Wave Field Synthesis (WFS) as an implicit solution of
the SFS problem and as explicit solutions, like Ambisonics in the spherical
domain and Spectral Division Method in the cartesian domain. Research and
development on Ambisonics and WFS proceeded since the 1970s and the late 1980s,
being most lively in the last decade due to DSP power available. This resulted
in many SFS systems at research institutes with different rendering methods,
thus complicating comparability and reproducibility. In order to pool the
outcomes of different SFS approaches the Matlab/Octave based Sound Field
Synthesis Toolbox was initiated 2010 as an open source project by the authors.
This toolbox was later accompanied by online theoretical documentation giving an
overview on the SFS approaches and citing the reference literature. In 2013
porting of the SFS Toolbox to Python was initiated, serving as convenient
framework together with Jupyter notebooks. In this contribution we discuss and
demonstrate the concepts, workflows and capabilities of the SFS Toolbox and
their documentation as fundamental component for open research on SFS.
