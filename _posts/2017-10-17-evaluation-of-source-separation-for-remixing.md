### Abstract

Music remixing is difficult when the original multitrack recording is not
available. One solution is to estimate the elements of a mixture using source
separation. However, existing techniques suffer from imperfect separation and
perceptible artifacts on single separated sources. To investigate their
influence on a remix, five state-of-the-art source separation algorithms were
used to remix six songs by increasing the level of the vocals. A listening test
was conducted to assess the remixes in terms of loudness balance and sound
quality. The results show that some source separation algorithms are able to
increase the level of the vocals by up to 6 dB at the cost of introducing a
small but perceptible degradation in sound quality.
