### Abstract

Sound Field Synthesis approaches aim at the reconstruction of a desired sound
field in a defined target region using a distribution of loudspeakers.
Near-Field Compensated Higher Order Ambisonics (NFCHOA) is a prominent example
of such techniques. In practical implementations different artifacts are
introduced to the synthesized sound field: spatial aliasing is caused by the
non-zero distance between the loudspeakers. Modal bandwidth limitation is a
well-established approach to reduce spatial aliasing in 2.5D NFCHOA, but
introduces temporal and spectral impairments to the reproduced sound field which
strongly depend on the relative position to the center of modal expansion. Also,
the dimensionality mismatch in a 2.5D synthesis scenario results in a different
amplitude decay compared to the desired sound field. Listening experiments
already investigated the azimuthal localization in 2.5D NFCHOA. It is however
unclear, in how far individual artifacts caused by spatial sampling, modal
bandwidth limitation, and the 2.5D dimensionality mismatch contribute to these
localization impairments in particular. Within this contribution a mathematical
framework is used together with binaural synthesis to simulate the individual
effect of each artifact on the ear signals. Humans' performance is approximated
by a binaural model for azimuthal localization.
