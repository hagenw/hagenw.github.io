### Abstract

TWO!EARS was an EU-funded project for binaural auditory modelling with ten
international partners involved. Its main goal was to provide a computational
framework for the modelling of active exploratory listening that assigns meaning
to auditory scenes. As one outcome of the project, a database including data
acquired by the involved partners as well as third-party measurements has been
published. Among others, a large collection of Head Related Impulse Responses
and Binaural Room Impulse Responses is part of the database. Further, results
from psychoacoustic experiments conducted within TWO!EARS to validate the
developed auditory model were added. For the usage of the database together with
the TWO!EARS model, a software interface was developed to download the data
from the database on demand.

### Supplementary material

comes with a [huge online
documentation](http://docs.twoears.eu/en/latest/database/).
