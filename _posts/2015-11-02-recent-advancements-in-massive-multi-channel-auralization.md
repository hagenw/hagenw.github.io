### Abstract

Massive multi-channel auralization approaches like Wave Field Synthesis and
Higher Order Ambisonics experienced a pronounced hype in the late 2000s during
which the primary research goal was maximizing the physical accuracy of the
synthetic sound fields that they create. The hype eventually faded as the
achievable advancements turned out to be limited due to fundamental
restrictions. Though, activities are still being pursued in the domain with the
focus shifted towards perception of synthetic sound fields. This talk gives an
overview over current activities, which aim at understanding localization,
timbre, and spatial impression in general. The results show that localization
performance in synthetic sound fields is close to the performance in real sound
fields. Timbre and spatial impression exhibit impairments that are directly
linked to the physical limitations of the employed systems. Promising options
for improvements regarding the synthesis of artificial reverberation are
discussed.
