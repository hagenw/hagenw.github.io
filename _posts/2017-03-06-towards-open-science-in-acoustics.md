### Abstract

The reproducibility of results is one of the main principles of the scientific
method. The irreproducibility of a wide range of scientific results has recently
drawn significant attention. Besides problems in the research methods
themselves, results were often not reproducible since necessary supplementary
material as protocols, data and implementations were not available. Another
issue is the lacking availability of data for further research by third parties.
In many cases only the published results are available to other researchers.
Open Science focuses on the ease of access and reproducibility of scientific
results. This contribution introduces the concept of reproducibility and
addresses common concerns. Best practices for Open Science in acoustics research
are discussed and illustrated at examples.
