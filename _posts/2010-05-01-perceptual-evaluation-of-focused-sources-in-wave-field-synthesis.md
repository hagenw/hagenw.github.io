### Abstract

Wave Field Synthesis provides the possibility to reproduce virtual sound sources
located between the loudspeaker array and the listener. Such sources are known
as focused sources. A previously published study including an informal listening
test has shown that the reproduction of focused sources is subject to audible
artifacts, especially for large loudspeaker arrays. The combination of the
time-reversal nature of focused sources and spatial sampling leads to pre-echos.
The perception of these artifacts is quite different depending on the relative
listener position. This paper describes a formal test which was conducted to
verify the perceptual relevance of the physical properties found in previous
papers.
