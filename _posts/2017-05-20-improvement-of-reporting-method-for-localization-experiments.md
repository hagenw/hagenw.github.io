### Abstract

Sound Field Synthesis reproduces a desired sound field within an extended
listening area using up to hundreds of loudspeakers. The perceptual evaluation
of such methods is challenging, as many degrees of freedom have to be
considered. Binaural Synthesis simulating the loudspeakers over headphones is an
effective tool for the evaluation. A prior study has investigated whether
non-individual anechoic binaural synthesis is perceptually transparent enough to
evaluate human localization in sound field synthesis. With the used apparatus,
an undershoot for lateral sound sources was observed for real loudspeakers and
their binaural simulation. This paper reassesses human localization for the
mentioned technique using a slightly modified setup. The results show that the
localization error decreased and no undershoot was observed.
