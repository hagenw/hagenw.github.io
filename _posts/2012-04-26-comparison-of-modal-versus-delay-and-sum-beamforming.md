### Abstract

Several approaches to data-based binaural synthesis have been published that
capture a sound field by means of a spherical microphone array. The captured
sound field is typically decomposed into plane waves which are then auralized
using head-related transfer functions (HRTFs). The decomposition into plane
waves is often based on modal beamforming techniques which represent the
captured sound field with respect to surface spherical harmonics. An efficient
and numerically stable approximation to modal beamforming is the delay-and-sum
technique. This paper compares these two beamforming techniques in the context
of data-based binaural synthesis. Their frequency- and time-domain properties
are investigated, as well as the perceptual properties of the resulting binaural
synthesis according to a binaural model.
