### Bibtex

### Abstract

- Download or fork the master branch of this theme repo into you GitHub account.
- Rename the repo into something like `your_username.github.io`.
- Edit `_config.yml` file to your preferences.
- Edit `about.md` file for your About page.
- Inside `_posts` folder, there are sample of blog entries. Learn from it and start yours.

### Errata

If you want to use this theme as a project page blog, you don't need to rename the theme repo into `your_username.github.io`.

All you need to do, open `_config.yml` file, change `baseurl` to your project name which contains this theme, e.g. `baseurl: "/myproject"`.
