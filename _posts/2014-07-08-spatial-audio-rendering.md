### Abstract

Complementary to non-spatialized signals and their transmission, this chapter
gives an overview of the quality of rendering methods that create spatial sound.
Common methods and the underlying concept of a virtual sound scene are
introduced and the herewith associated quality features. In particular,
evaluation strategies and experimental results are presented in order to discuss
spatial and timbral quality features of spatial audio rendering.
