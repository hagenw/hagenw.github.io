### Abstract

Science relies on the traceability and replicability of studies. Aiming for
sustainability, this is important for the authors itself as well as for the
research community once results become published. Ideally the entire research
process, from initial concepts till publication, shall be performed under the
open science paradigm. Recent efforts in the open source software community led
to convenient tools for research data management. Nowadays, it is almost
self-evident that researchers are engaged in the professional typesetting
process using the mature LaTeX front-end with graphical packages like TikZ.
Furthermore, version-control systems such as Git are probably used by a large
part of the community for open and closed source projects. Besides that, the
open source programming language Python and its various open tools for code
development gradually become predominant, supporting the open science paradigm.
Jupyter notebooks together rapidly gain importance in the workflow for
prototyping, documentation and education. Documentation tools like ”Sphinx” and
free hosting platforms like ”Read the Docs” are emerging front-ends that allow
versioned technical documentation with hyperlinks. In this contribution we
discuss and demonstrate a current reliable workflow for open science/research
starting from puzzling ideas to publishing results.
