### Abstract

The area of sound field synthesis has significantly advanced in the past
decade, facilitated by the development of high-quality sound-field capturing
and re-synthesis systems. Spherical microphone arrays are among the most
recently developed systems for sound field capturing, enabling processing and
analysis of three-dimensional sound fields in the spherical harmonics domain.
In spite of these developments, a clear relation between sound fields recorded
by spherical microphone arrays and their perception with a re-synthesis system
has not yet been established, although some relation to scalar measures of
spatial perception was recently presented. This paper presents an experimental
study of spatial sound perception with the use of a spherical microphone array
for sound recording and headphone-based binaural sound synthesis. Sound field
analysis and processing is performed in the spherical harmonics domain with the
use of head-related transfer functions and simulated enclosed sound fields. The
effect of several factors, such as spherical harmonics order, frequency
bandwidth, and spatial sampling, are investigated by applying the repertory
grid technique to the results of the experiment, forming a clearer relation
between sound-field capture with a spherical microphone array and its
perception using binaural synthesis regarding space, frequency, and additional
artifacts. The experimental study clearly shows that a source will be perceived
more spatially sharp and more externalized when represented by a binaural
stimuli reconstructed with a higher spherical harmonics order. This effect is
apparent from low spherical harmonics orders. Spatial aliasing, as a result of
sound field capturing with a finite number of microphones, introduces
unpleasant artifacts which increased with the degree of aliasing error.
