### Abstract

Sound Field Synthesis techniques including Wave Field Synthesis and
Near-Field-Compensated Higher Order Ambisonics aim at a physically accurate
reproduction of a desired sound field inside an extended listening area. This
area is surrounded by loudspeakers individually driven by their respective
driving signals. The latter have to be chosen such that the superposition of all
emitted sound fields coincides with the desired one. Due to practical
limitations, artefacts impair the synthesis accuracy resulting in a perceivable
change in timbre. Recently, two approaches to so-called Local Wave Field
Synthesis were published which enhance the reproduction accuracy in a limited
region while allowing stronger artefacts outside. This work reports on two
listening experiments comparing conventional techniques for Sound Field
Synthesis with the mentioned approaches. Furthermore, the influence of different
parametrisations for Local Wave Field Synthesis is investigated. The results
show that the enhanced reproduction accuracy in Local Wave Field Synthesis leads
to a reduction of perceived colouration, if a suitable parametrisation is
chosen.
