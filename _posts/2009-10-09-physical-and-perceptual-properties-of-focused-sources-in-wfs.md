### Abstract

Wave Field Synthesis is a well-established high-resolution spatial sound
reproduction technique. Its physical basis allows to reproduce almost any
desired wave field, even sound sources positioned in between the loudspeakers
and the listener. Such sources are known as focused sources. Focused sources
have a number of remarkable physical properties, especially in the context of
spatial sampling. This paper presents a detailed analysis of the physical
properties of focused sources as well as their perceptual impact. Additionally,
results of a first informal listening experiment are discussed in order to
gather knowledge on the perceptual relevance of the derived artifacts in
practical implementations.
