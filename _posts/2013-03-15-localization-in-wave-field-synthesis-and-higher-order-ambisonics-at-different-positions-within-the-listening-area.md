### Abstract

Sound field synthesis techniques like Wave Field Synthesis and Higher Order
Ambisonics have the advantage of providing correct localization within an
extended area in comparison to the sweet-spot phenomenon in stereophony.
In practice the localization could be disturbed by errors in the synthesized
sound field due to the obliged usage of a non-continuous loudspeaker array.
This study investigates for different types of virtual sources (point sources,
plane waves, focused sources) the influence of the applied loudspeaker spacing
on the localization. Therefore subjects were placed at many different positions
within the listening area for Wave Field Synthesis and Higher Order Ambisonics.
The investigation of different positions and loudspeaker arrays was achieved by
applying dynamic binaural synthesis to simulate the corresponding ear signals
for the different conditions. The participants listened to the conditions
via headphones and indicated the perceived direction by pointing with a head
mounted laser pointer towards this direction.
