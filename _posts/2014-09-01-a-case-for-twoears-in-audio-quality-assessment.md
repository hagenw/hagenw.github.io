### Abstract

The paper presents first results on audio-quality evaluation following the
auditory-perception modeling paradigm of TWO!EARS, a FET-Open project funded
under FP7 ICT by the European Commission
([www.twoears.eu](http://www.twoears.eu)).  The project targets an interactive
system for binaural auditory perception, including input from the visual
modality. In its ultimate form, it will be based on an interactive robot
platform combining bottom-up cues from monaural and binaural signal processing
with hypothesis-driven top-down cognition, organized around an expert-system
with black-board architecture. One of the two proof-of-concept applications is
that of audio-quality evaluation for loudspeaker-based reproduction. Here,
targeted key innovations include a dedicated scene-based evaluation paradigm,
active exploration of sound fields using head-movements and displacement, the
combination of bottom-up information with top-down feedback and adaptation, and
the dedicated use of internal rather than external references within the expert
system. The paper presents research conducted in the course of model
development. Two first findings along these lines will be presented: (1) A
listening test was conducted to assess the localization performance of human
listeners for several near-field compensated higher-order Ambisonics setups.  A
binaural model was able to predict the perceived direction with good accuracy.
However, for some positions in the listening area, listeners reported to
perceive more than one auditory event. This result was not predicted by the
binaural model, which instead returned a single source direction. By endowing
the binaural model with the ability of head rotations, it could be expanded so
as to more accurately predict whether the listener perceived one or more
sources, and from which direction. (2) A first pilot test has been conducted to
address the scene-based test-paradigm targeted by TWO!EARS. Here, a scene with
two guitars and one singer playing a musical piece was reproduced via different
Wave Field Synthesis systems so as to selectively degrade one or multiple of the
three sources. The different conditions were assessed in a paired comparison
preference test, indicating, among other findings, that the reference scene was
clearly not the preferred one. The paper summarizes the results and provides an
outlook on future developments on sound quality modeling in the TWO!EARS
project.
