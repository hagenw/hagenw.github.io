### Abstract

Sound Field Synthesis techniques, such as Wave Field Synthesis aim at a
physically accurate reproduction of a desired sound field inside an extended
listening area. This area is surrounded by loudspeakers individually driven by
their respective driving signals. Due to practical limitations, artefacts impair
the synthesis accuracy resulting in a perceivable change in timbre compared to
the desired sound field. Recently, an approach for so-called Local Wave Field
Synthesis was published which enhances the reproduction accuracy in a limited
region by applying a spatial bandwidth limitation in the circular/spherical
harmonics domain to the desired sound field. This paper reports on a listening
experiment comparing conventional Sound Field Synthesis techniques with the
mentioned approach. Also the influence of the different parametrisations for
Local Wave Field Synthesis is investigated. The results show that the enhanced
reproduction accuracy in Local Wave Field Synthesis leads to an improvement with
regard to the perceived colouration.
