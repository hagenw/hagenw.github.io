### Abstract

The paper presents results on spatial audio quality evaluation and approaches
for modeling the data using binaural-hearing models, following the interactive
and object-related framework developed in the EC-funded FET-Open project
TWO!EARS (www.twoears.eu, see also Raake & Blauert QoMEX 2013, Raake et al.
Forum Acusticum 2014). Two types of tests and respective modeling approaches are
presented: (1) Feature modeling following the well-established approach of
spatial and timbral fidelity prediction. To this aim, a feature-specific set of
listening tests was conducted for ground-truth data collection. The resulting
feature models apply different parts of the bottom-up auditory processing
modules from the TWO!EARS framework.  (2) Preference modeling. For collecting
the underlying data, a listening test series was conducted applying tailored
mixes for different musical pieces with different variations of the mixing
choices for specific sources in the scene. Using a full paired-comparison test
paradigm, preference ratings were collected from listeners. The respective model
involves TWO!EARSâ€™ scene segregation for object identification and subsequent
object-specific feature extraction.
