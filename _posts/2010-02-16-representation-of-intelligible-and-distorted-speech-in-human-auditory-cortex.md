### Abstract

The aim of the study is to identify cortical regions that process the meaning of
spoken language, irrespective of acoustical realization, by means of functional
MRI. Distorted speech material is used along with clean speech to allow for a
controlled manipulation of intelligibility, depending on the presentation order.
Speech distortion was performed by rotating spectral features. Psychophysical
experiments were performed with 230 sentences of a speech intelligibility test
in German language, to explore the effect of presentation order of clean and
distorted speech. Results from 15 listeners indicate that distorted signals can
reliably be presented either in a way well to understand, or completely
unintelligible, depending on the exact presentation relative to the other speech
material. The results were used to design a functional MRI experiment that
allowed us to image brain activation for identical acoustic stimuli, only
differing in their intelligibility. The fMRI data indicate that speech stimuli
in general cause bilateral activation in the temporal lobes. The contrast
between natural and distorted speech only comes up in regions beyond primary
auditory areas, mainly in superior temporal gyrus. The contrast between
acoustically identical stimuli only differing in their intelligibility reveals
several areas, largely in the left hemisphere and clearly separate from the
temporal lobes. These regions are interpreted to represent the processing of the
meaning of intelligible speech, irrespective of their exact acoustical
properties.
