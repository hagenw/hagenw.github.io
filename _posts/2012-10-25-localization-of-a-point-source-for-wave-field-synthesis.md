### Abstract

One of the main advantages of Wave Field Synthesis (WFS) is the existence of an
extended listening area contrary to the sweet spot in stereophony. At the moment
there is only little literature available on the actual localization properties
of WFS at different points in the listening area.  One reason is the difficulty
to place different subjects reliable at different positions. This study
systematically investigates the localization performance for WFS at many
positions within the listening area. To overcome the difficulty to place
subjects, the different listening positions and loudspeaker arrays were
simulated by dynamic binaural synthesis.  In a pre-study it was verified that
this method is suitable to investigate the localization performance in WFS.
