        Hi, I'm Hagen,
        a researcher at
        <a href="https://audeering.com">audEERING</a>,
        where I work
        on signal processing
        and deep learning
        for audio and speech.
        I'm interested in
        <strong>testing</strong>
        and <strong>reproducibility</strong> in machine learning,
        speech <strong>emotion</strong> recognition,
        <strong>spatial audio</strong>,
        and <strong>sound quality</strong>.

      <h3>Bio</h3>
      <p>
        I received my Diploma (equivalent to a M.Sc.) in Physics
        from Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg
        in 2008
        with a thesis in the field of psychoacoustics and neuroscience.
        I received a Doctoral Degree
        from Technische Universität Berlin
        on the topic of perceptual assessment of sound field synthesis systems
        in 2014
        and continued as a Post-Doc.
        In 2016
        I moved as a Post-Doc to Technische Universität Ilmenau
        and was a Visiting Professor at Filmuniversität Babelsberg KONRAD WOLF.
        In 2017 I was a Post-Doc at the University of Surrey,
        evaluating musical source separation algorithms.
        Since 2018 I'm a senior researcher at audEERING.
